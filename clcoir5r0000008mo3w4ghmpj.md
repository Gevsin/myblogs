# "Stay Up-to-Date with DevBytes: The Time-Saving App for Tech Professionals"

## Introduction

Well, in today's article, I won't talk about anything related to Flutter but I am here to talk about an app that I have been using for the past few weeks and that I really like the app. The app is called DevBytes. There are a lot of apps that I like so I decided to review all these apps and create a new section under my blog.

DevBytes is specifically designed for busy developers, product managers, and engineering managers who want to stay up-to-date on the latest happenings in the tech world, but don't have the time to wade through lengthy articles.

With DevBytes, you'll get all the coding news you need in a short and crisp format. No fluff, no filler - just the information you need to stay informed and ahead of the game. Plus, the app is constantly updated with the latest news, so you'll never fall behind.

## Overview

### Onboarding

Let me take you through a quick walkthrough of the Devbytes app. Once you download the app, you will be asked to fill in your preferences and your interests. Next up, you will be asked to sign in via Google or Twitter. That's it. That's all it takes to onboard on Devbytes.

### The Core

Your home screen will contain news articles. It will be displayed to you one by one in a timely manner. It is like a carousel. If you are interested to know more about the news you are reading, you can just tap on the article and the app will take you to the source of the article.

There are 2 sections namely All news and My feed. All news contains top and trending news whereas my feed contains news tailored to your preferences. Remember you filled in your current role and preferences at the start? Yeah, it uses that to populate my feed section.

### There's more!

Along with the short and crisp tech news, DevBytes also provides you with a section called CryptoWatch. It is basically a crypto index watcher. You can see the current prices of all the major cryptocurrencies. It is a cute little feature.

Also, DevBytes have this section called as deals where you can get a good amount of deals on particular brands. You just need to do particular tasks to unlock the same.

## Key Features

Well, we can find news on Google, Twitter, and Linkedin as well so why Devbytes? I think that it is very easy to get distracted on platforms like Linkedin & Twitter because you get news and then you get memes as well. So there is no consistency.

In DevBytes, there is only news and nothing else. Also, DevBytes have an amazing feature to schedule your notifications. It will send you notifications of news articles after a particular interval.

**I personally use DevBytes to stay up-to-date with the current happenings of the world. I use DevBytes because of these key factors:**

1. Time-saving: As mentioned, the app provides coding news in a short and concise format, so you can stay informed without having to spend hours reading long articles.
    
2. Targeted: DevBytes is specifically designed for developers, product managers, and engineering managers, so the news and information provided are highly relevant to your profession.
    
3. Efficient: By providing only the most important and relevant news, DevBytes helps you make the most of your time and stay efficient in your professional development.
