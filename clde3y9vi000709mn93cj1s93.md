# Unlocking the Power of Internationalization in your Flutter App

## Introduction üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Making a multi-language app in Flutter is a great way to cater to a global audience and provide a seamless experience for users who speak different languages. With Flutter's easy-to-use localization features, it's possible to create an app that can adapt to other languages with minimal effort. In this blog post, we will explore the flutter\_locales package in Flutter.

We will also discuss best practices for testing and debugging your multi-language app and tips for making sure your app is accessible to users with different language needs. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this guide will help you create a multi-language app that is both functional and user-friendly.

So without wasting any time, let's get started.

## Project Setup üíª

First of all, import the flutter\_locales package into your project.

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_locales: ^2.0.2
```

Next, create JSON files for the languages that you want in your app. The JSON files will be key-value pair files where the key will be the text to be displayed and the value will be its translation.

![Example app assets/locales](https://github.com/iampopal/flutter_locales/raw/master/assets.png align="left")

In the above image, there are two json files, one for English and the other for Arabic.

Create these JSON files in the locales folder. Make sure, the locales folder is in your assets folder. Also, don't forget to include assets/locales/ folder in your YAML file.

```dart
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/locales/
```

## Coding the Logic ‚öíÔ∏è

First of all, make these changes in your void main function.

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized(); 
  await Locales.init(['en', 'fa']); // get last saved language
  // remove await if you want to get app default language
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

`WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is a method that is used to initialize the Flutter framework. This method is typically called at the beginning of the `main()` function in a Flutter app. The purpose of this method is to ensure that the Flutter framework has been properly initialized and set up before any other code is executed.

Next, we will wrap our MaterialApp with the `LocaleBuilder` widget. This widget comes in-built with the flutter\_locales package.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return LocaleBuilder(
      builder: (locale) => MaterialApp(
        title: 'Flutter Locales',
        localizationsDelegates: Locales.delegates,  
        supportedLocales: Locales.supportedLocales, // the languages that we support
        locale: locale,  // tells about current language
        home: HomeScreen(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Now, if we want our Text to change the language at the press of a button, we only need one line of code.

```dart
Locales.change(context, 'fa');
```

We can't use the normal text widget to display our text though, we have to use the `LocaleText()` widget which comes along with the flutter\_locales package.

```dart
LocaleText(`welcome`,style:TextStyle(color:Colors.black));
```

You can also know about the current app language by calling this function

```dart
Locales.currentLocale(context);
```

## Conclusion üëãüèª

So with this, we come to an end. `flutter_locales` makes life much easier if you want to add multi-language support to your app. There are a few more packages that do the job. You can check them out on pub.dev. I hope you learned something new today.
