# 5 Open-Source Flutter Projects to Boost Your Skills

## Introduction üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Open-Source is the best way to get your hands on complex and well-structured Flutter projects. Many people wish to do open-source after learning something new but they don't know where to begin with. So I have compiled a list of 5 Flutter projects, to which you can refer and improve your skills.

There are beginner-friendly issues to fix as well, so you may also try to fix a problem and make your first open-source contribution.

## 1) Blackhole

Blackhole is an open-source music player app. It is an alternative to Spotify. It has more than 4,000 stars. The contributors and maintainers are pretty active as well. You can check out the repository by following [this link.](https://github.com/Sangwan5688/BlackHole)

## 2) Fwitter

Whenever you start learning something, the best way to learn is to build something. In most cases, we end up building a clone of a popular application like Instagram or Twitter. This is exactly what Fwitter is. Fwitter is Twitter built in Flutter and it is open-source.

It has 2,000+ stars and it is very active. You can learn a lot from this project as it is fully functional. The codebase would be very well-structured and neat. Here is the [codebase.](https://github.com/TheAlphamerc/flutter_twitter_clone)

## 3) **Airdash**

Airdash is an app used to transfer photos and files to any device. It is a fully functional file transfer app. You can transfer from any device to another without being on the same network. You will get to learn a lot about WebRTC and sockets if you study this codebase.

I think it is a great project for devs who are looking to understand some intermediate/advanced concepts of networks. You can find the repository link [right here.](https://github.com/simonbengtsson/airdash)
